# Introduction
It is not unheard that one's party preference are highly associated with one's opinions on certain issues. Parties that are on the right end of the spectrum are more likely to be anti-immigrants while parties that are on the left end of the spectrum tend to have more open policy on immigrants. As a result, it will be reasonably to assume that if an individual has negative view on immigrants is more likely to support a party whose ideology aligns with this and vice versa.

In this study, I will investigate the correlation between individuals' views on immigrants and their voting behavior with a focus on Finnish population. The hypothesis is formulated as follows,

*Do peopel who have more negative views on immigrants more likely to vote for praties that are right-leaning?*

The data being used in this study is from round 11 (2023/24) of European Social Suvery (ESS).
